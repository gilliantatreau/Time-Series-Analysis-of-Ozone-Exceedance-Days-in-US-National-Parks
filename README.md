# Time Series Analysis of Ozone Exceedance Days in US National Parks
ARIMA time series analysis, ADF tests, graphical analysis, EDA for ozone exceedance days in US National Parks.

Ozone is a pollutant and major component of smog. It also poses a significant danger to living cells- damaging the tissues found in the respiratory tract and in the leaves of plants. An ozone exceedance day occurs on each calendar day when the daily maximum 8-hour average is greater than or equal to 71 ppb. Models were created to predict the number of ozone exceedance days and the values for the daily maximum 8-hour average ozone concentration and annual fourth-highest daily maximum 8-hour average ozone concentration for four individual sites and generalized data to represent all sites.
